# sqlalchemy - Surf Up!

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.


## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

Used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis was completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

* Used the provided [starter notebook](climate_starter.ipynb) and [hawaii.sqlite](Resources/hawaii.sqlite) files to complete the climate analysis and data exploration.

* Chose a start date and end date for the trip. 

* Use SQLAlchemy `create_engine` to connect to the sqlite database.

* Use SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` to reflect the tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called `Station` and `Measurement`.


### Precipitation Analysis

* Designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and selected only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and setted the index to the date column.

* Sorted the DataFrame values by `date` and plotted the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.

* Used Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Station Analysis

* Designed a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Designed a query to find the most active stations.

* Designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).

  * Filtered by the station with the highest number of observations.

  * Plotted the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

## Step 2 - Climate App

Designed a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

* Use Flask to create your routes.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * Listed all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Converted the query results to a dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

  * Returned the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Returned a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
  * Query the dates and temperature observations of the most active station for the last year of data.
  
  * Returned a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Returned a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.

  * calculated `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all dates greater than and equal to the start date when given the start only.

  * calculated the `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for dates between the start and end date inclusive  When given the start and the end date.
